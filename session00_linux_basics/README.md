## Working with files using vi editor

Save file without making changes 	| `:q!`
Delete a file |	`rm filename`
Go to the last line |	`G`
Go to first line    |	`:1 or gg`
Jump to line 25     |	`:25 or 25G`

## Transfer folders/files
To know the full path, type `pwd` in your terminal.

Copy directories from local to remote computer <br>
`scp -r fullpath/ user@hostname:/fullpath/`

Copy directories from remote to local computer <br>
`scp -r user@hostname:/fullpath/ /fullpath_in_local_computer`

Copy directories from remote computer to another remote computer <br>
`scp -r user1@hostname1:/fullpath/ user2@hostname2:/fullpath/`

If you are not transferring directories, but only files, after `scp`, `-r` is not required.
